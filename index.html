								<p>A historic window has opened</p>

								<p>Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology is at the advent of becoming critical infrastructure for the world. Smart contracts are finally unbounded on top of bitcoin.
									But mining does not reflect the “unbounded” nature of Satoshi’s Vision. The training wheels have been taken off, but mining is still constrained by the thinking of the past era.
									Our goal is to revitalize and re-innovate mining for this new era with a next generation on-chain mining pool and to fund it by conducting the first true crowdsale on top of Bitcoin.</p>
								<p><b>We propose a decentralized, on-chain mining pool for truly-unbounded, general-purpose computation on Bitcoin as envisioned by Satoshi Nakomoto (BSV). It overcomes limits of existing pools by compensating miners proportionally to block size and the amount of energy required for executing unbounded smart contracts, thereby creating an energy oracle. By fairly rewarding general computation, MOAT will shift payouts towards miners on general-purpose hardware.</b></p>
								Bitcoin transactions are smart contracts in their simplest, most fundamental form. But contracts have been limited on top of Bitcoin by a bevy of arbitrary constraints. Among them are the contract size limit, block size limit, the opcode number limit, and many opcodes being turned off. But now, the locks have been taken off and unbounded, general computation is now possible on top of Bitcoin (BSV).
<p>
Bitcoin’s training wheels have been taken off, but mining is still constrained by the thinking of the past era. We will revitalize mining with a next generation, on-chain mining pool and fund it by conducting the first crowdsale for the first feature-complete token on top of Bitcoin. This mining pool will be founded on a new concept of mining for the new era of Bitcoin. 
<br><br>
Mining has to change, because the work to mine a block has changed. The nature of the work required to validate a block of transactions and build a block header in the era of unbounded smart contracts is very different from pure hashing. For miners whose endeavours are rapidly commoditized over time, the difference between accurately accounting for this work, versus not doing so, can mean the difference between being in the black or in the red. As smart contracts become longer and more complex, this problem will get much worse.
<br><br>
Mining needs a new way to reward the miners for their work, a method that scales with the block size and complexity of the contract. There is one way to measure work that is easy to validate and hard to fake: power consumption. Computation requires energy. We incentivize succinct snapshots (power attestations) from your GrandMa’s Bitcoin miners about their power consumption. Power attestations will then be validated using gametheoretic guarantees and network analysis, then used in the payout structure.
<br><br>
Incidentally, these snapshots will also serve as proof-of-delivery of electricity allowing us to build on-chain marketplaces for electricity and energy tokens. Mining is the outpoint for all the energy that goes into Bitcoin, and of course it's also how transactions are processed. If we track the energy of mining on-chain, we also track the energy of transactions, smart contracts, and computation. By creating a network of power attestations, the network could become a global energy oracle.
</p>
									<p>Whether you're a miner, a smart-scrivener, a quantum information scientist or just a kitchen (al)chemist, you can now be part of minting a new era.</p>

<h1>What is MOAT?</h1>
<ui>
	<li>It’s a network-wide mining pool so everyone gets paid</li>
	<li>It pays the network for computation based off the energy consumed</li>
	<li>It is Built on BSV, the One True Bitcoin</li>
	<li>It solves the 51% takeover problem</li>
</ui>
<br><br>
<h1>Why it is better</h1>
<ui>
	<li>It is built on BSV, which is better than ethereum because of unlimited blocksize.</li>
	<li>Sharding on BSV is solved by default.</li>
	<li>With Moat, everyone is rewarded for mining because it is a single mining pool.</li>
	<li>It is more decentralized by design. Most bitcoin mining happens in large mining pools, which creates centralization and makes a 51% attack more likely.</li>
</ui>
<br><h3>
		Use of funds 
	</h3>
	<p>The MOAT team will use it to develop the oracle and the decentralized mining pool. </p>
	<h3>
		What tokens will be used for
	</h3>
	<p>You will be able to use tokens for general computation on the BSV chain. By providing computation, miners will earn tokens. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>A new world for Bitcoin: Satoshi’s Vision</h2>
	<br>
	<p>When Bitcoin first began, Satoshi had a vision for it, where any transaction could be published on its public ledger. Since then, constraints were put on the system, limiting the kind of transaction that could occur. These constraints limited Bitcoin’s evolution as a network. Until now. The limitations have now been removed with the creation of Bitcoin SV, freeing Bitcoin to expand outside of normal transactions. With Bitcoin SV (Bitcoin), Satoshi’s original intentions for the network are finally being realized.</p>
		
	<p>At Moat, we are realizing this new potential in the network. We are creating the world’s first true Token on top of Bitcoin. You can think of a token as a new currency that is validated and backed by the Bitcoin network, making it secure and transferable.</p>

	<p>​Miners in Moat’s network will be able to earn tokens for their work. Individuals will be able to buy and sell their tokens on exchanges. And people will be able to purchase tokens from Moat in the world’s first true crowdsale on top of Bitcoin.</p>
	<h3>The challenge of mining pools</h3>
	<p>When mining on Bitcoin first began, individuals were able to use their own computers, connect them to the network, and begin making money by being awarded what are called mining blocks. With Bitcoin’s expansion, it has become nearly impossible for individual miners to make a profit. From this, Mining Pools began to emerge. Users can join mining pools, and whenever someone in the pool is awarded a block, everyone in the pool shares in the reward, relative to how much computing power they contributed.</p>
	<h3>Risks of Bitcoin mining pools</h3>
	<p>But this came at a cost. One of Bitcoin’s greatest features is that it is decentralized. No centralized authority controls Bitcoin, or makes decisions for the network. But mining pools are centralized under a single authority, and they are consuming a greater and greater percentage of the network. If the three most major mining pools colluded, they could make decisions for Bitcoin’s future, taking it out of the hands of individuals.
	</p>
	<h3>Moat is a decentralized mining pool</h3>
	<p>Just like the Bitcoin network itself, Moat will be decentralized. No single authority controls the pool, with the goal of making it fully decentralized. Miners will be able to join the network, earn tokens for their work, and make decisions for the network’s future. A network that is truly in the hands of the users.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Why We're Building on BSV</h2>
	<P>Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (or BSV) is what could be called the real Bitcoin Network, since it is setup the way Satoshi envisioned it. It has the capabilities of Ethereum, but has solved the problem of scaling, by using Horizontal Scaling instead of Vertical. It is also far faster than Ethereum or almost any crypto currency. And with new advancements, such as their Teranode Project, it has the potential to be the fastest network on the planet, far surpassing Visa and other centralized platforms. While Ethereum has very high gas fees, transactions costs are kept low on BSV by design. With new tools being developed for everyday, such as Token Pro’s uniswap, and Volt building a bridge between blockchain ecosystems, we believe now is the perfect time to launch.</P>
	<h2>A new way to look at energy</h2>
	<br>
	<h3>A problem of takeovers</h3>
	<p>A question early on for Bitcoin was how to prevent someone from taking over the network. The ideal is that every participant has a say in changes made, and if 51% agree on something, the change is implemented. But how do you keep track of these participants? Everyone’s identification on Bitcoin is created using what is called a Public Key, which works as a form of identification. But an individual could generate thousands, or millions, of public keys and takeover the network. What prevents this from happening?</p>
	<h3>Solved with proof of work</h3>
	<p>It is accomplished using what is called Proof of Work. By solving mathematical puzzles, which take up a large amount of computing power to accomplish, you prove that you possess that computation, and are unable to fool the network. But this comes at a cost. The energy consumed on Bitcoin’s network is currently greater than the energy consumed by Ireland, and a large number of developing countries.</p>
	<h3>Power</h3>
	<p>Moat is creating a new form of energy accounting. Each participant will have the power they use to mine validated on-chain, and will receive rewards for their work. We are changing the way people keep track of power.</p>
	<h3>We are excited to be pioneering the next stage in the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized ecosystems. Join us as we mint a new era!</h3>

									AIR 🌬️ <br>15% of Sales Tokens<br> 
									<br><br>
									FIRE 🔥  <br>10% of Sales Tokens</br>
									</h4>
									<br>
							<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
							<p>The MOAT Token (XRN) Crowdsale will support the development, operations, and maintenance of the Moat Network. It will provide funding to the Founding Team, including engineers, advisors, and business operations. It will also provide grants for the support and growth of the Moat community. A percentage will also go toward the Foundation to support Moat's longterm progress and survival. There will be ~210*10^6 total tokens corresponding to the energy necessary to mine each satoshi.</p>
							<p><b>Token Distribution</b></p>
							<p>Tokens will be distributed in the form of an auction. The bigger your purchase is, the bigger the total percentage of tokens you will receive. For example, if one person purchases tokens for a thousand dollars, they would receive 100% of the tokens alloted for the crowdsale. But if someone else then makes a purchase of 9,000 dollars, the first person would get 10% of the crowdsale, and the second would receive 90%. The final allocation will be determined at the end of the crowdsale period.</p>
							<p><b>Token Delivery</b></p>
							<p>The allocated amount of tokens for each buyer will be sent after the end of the crowdsale to the address the buyer providesd during the sale. For this reason, you will need to provide a BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) address.</p>
							<p><b>Token Rounds</b></p>
							<p>The price of XRN in each round will depend on the amount of BSV contributed to buy XRN.
								The remaining XRN will be mined over time and rewarded to bitcoin miners, other power use attestants, and oracle participants.
								</p>
							<p><b>Token Use</b></p>
							<p>The tokens will be used in the future on the Moat Network to reward miners based on the energy they contribute. For this reason, you can think of MOAT as both an Energy Token and a Mining Token. This gives it concrete value, since it will represent the amount of Bitcoin mined in the network.</p>
